## 👋 Yo! I'm **Ajhesh Basnet**

Just a guy who fell in love with **AI**, **LLMs**, and everything in-between 😁🔥  

🚀 Currently:
- Playing with large models like Lego bricks
- Experimenting with fine-tuning and low-resource languages
- Turning weird ideas into code… or sometimes just into bugs 😂

🌟 My motto:  
_"Talk is cheap, show me the code…"_

🤝 Want to connect, collaborate, or nerd out about this stuff?
